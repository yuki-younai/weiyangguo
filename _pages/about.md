I am a PHD student (not yet enrolled) at the Harbin Institute of Technology, Shenzhen, supervised by Prof. [Li Jin](https://www.li-jing.com).  I graduated with a Honors Bachelor's Degree from the YingCai Honors College of the University of Electronic Science and Technology (UESTC) with a major in Computer Science and Technology.

My research interests include LLM Alignment, LLM Safety,  Reinforcement learning. I have published 3 paper in the international conference, include ACL, KDD, DASFAA.
